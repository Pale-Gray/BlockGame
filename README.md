# BlockGame

This was a project that I've been working on but stopped working on it because I wasn't motivated to do it anymore.

This includes
- First Person movement
- Drectional lighting
- FBO
- "Particles" (the leaf)
- textures

The Shader code is from a link (its in the class file)

# Controls

WASD to move
Up and Down arrow keys to increase FBO resolution
Shift / Space to move up or down
Mouse movement to look around
(I think) M to toggle view mouse or not
